|Example of a one-dimensional (constraint) knapsack problem: which books should be chosen to maximize the amount of money while still keeping the overall weight under or equal to 15 kg? A multiple-constrained problem could consider both the weight and volume of the books. (Solution: if any number of each book is available, then three yellow books and three grey books; if only the shown books are available, then all except for the green book. [^1])|

## Objective
To design a predictor for the solution of the following class of knapsack optimization problems:


$$\max \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} | \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_ix_i$$ 
$$x \in \{0,1\}^{n}$$
